- remove Nagle algorithm
	- use TCP_NODELAY

- support multiple client connections at the same time
	- first client has control
	- additional clients can see the traffic
		- read-only: requests from controlling client and responses from tty device
	- need to avoid unintentional lock up if controlling client stays connected but user goes away and forgets about it
		- additional clients should be able to force disconnecting controlling client
		- first additional client that forces this becomes controlling client

- require username when connecting to the server
	- allows tracking users
	- makes the feature above (forcing disconnect) easier to use
		- username can be connected to a person easier than an IP address
